## 1. Introduction
 This is part of Udacity Data Science course.For this project I have choosed - Using Spark to Predict Churn with Insight Data Science.
 Manipulated large and realistic datasets with Spark for predicting churn. Used Spark MLlib to build machine learning models with large datasets.<br>

## 4. Methodology
*Importing and cleaning the data*<br>   The data is stored in JSON files, and needs to be cleaned and transformed before it can be analyzed.<br>
*Exploratory data analysis*<br>         Use Spark to explore the data and identify any trends or patterns.<br>
*Feature engineering*<br>               Create new features from the raw data that may be useful for modeling.<br>
*Modeling*<br>                          Use Spark's machine learning library to train a model to predict churn (when a user stops using the service).<br>
*Evaluation*<br>                        Evaluate the model's performance and determine its accuracy.<br>
